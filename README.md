# 🎬 Movies App

A sleek and modern **React Native** mobile application that allows users to explore and search for movies, just like the **IMDb** app.

This app utilizes the [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) to fetch up-to-date movie information, including cast details, ratings, and more. Built using **Expo**, styled with **NativeWind** (Tailwind CSS for React Native), and structured with best practices for a smooth developer and user experience.
